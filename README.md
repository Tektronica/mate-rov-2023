# MATE ROV Competition

This year the MATE ROV Competition is highlighting the [United Nations Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development](https://en.unesco.org/ocean-decade) and aligning its mission tasks with one or more of the [17 UN Sustainable Development Goals](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/). This 2023 MATE ROV Competition also continues to inspire ESG principles in order to do “good for good” for our ocean, planet, and global community. These “clients” once again present you with request for proposals (RFP)...

The MATE ROV Competition is challenging its community to design and build a remotely operated vehicle and the necessary sensors, tooling, and complementary technologies to combat climate change, provide clean energy, monitor ocean health, and heal and protect our aquatic habitats from the mountains to the sea so that we can “[deliver, together, the ocean we need for the future we want!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcQ8JRxHSXk)”
